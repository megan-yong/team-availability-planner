<h1>Team Availability Planner</h1>

<b>Date completed:</b> October 21, 2023

<h2>Description</h2>

A Python program to calculate which day of the week would have the most participation based on input from team members regarding their availability. 

Each member will have to input the days of the week they are available. If there is no input, it outputs “Team member missing critical information”. For each day in the member’s availability, +1 is added to that date on the frequency table. The code then selects the day with the most available people to attend the function. 

With the best day determined with computer precision, the attendees are informed about the function’s day via email. A form email is created to send to each of the participants with data (information) about the function. An alternate email is sent to those who are unable to attend with more data (information) about a later function.
